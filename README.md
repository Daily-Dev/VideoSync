# YouTube Now
This Chrome extension uses the contextMenus API to make searching YouTube a click away.

To use highlight a word or phrase you would like to search for and right click to open the chrome context menu.  Select the "Search YouTube for 'foobar'" option in the menu.  A new tab will open and automatically play the most relavant video to the search.

## Future Additions:
* An option that allows the user to display the top search result in a modal on the active tab rather than create a completely new tab.
